CuRe your FAQs with CuRe Bot!  
CuRe Bot is a custom response bot for discord (similar to slackbot's custom responses ðŸ˜„).  
Just set up message triggers, and CuRe bot will faithfully respond.  
CuRe bot is designed and intended for support communities. Simply set a trigger (like: "open a ticket") and a response like "You can open a ticket with the `;;ticket open help` command).  
Check out an example below!  
  
To invite the bot to your server, use this link: https://discordapp.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=592968118905733120&permissions=0&scope=bot

Commands:
 - `*help`
 - `*create your trigger - your response`
    - This command creates a trigger. Whenever a user sends a message containing the "trigger" string, the bot will respond with the "response" string.
 - `*list`
    - Shows a list of the triggers and responses on the server.
 - `*delete index`
    - Deletes a trigger from the server. To get the trigger's index, use the `*list` command.
